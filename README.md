# IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on sentiment classification using the IMDB dataset, which includes 50,000 highly polar movie reviews. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify movie reviews as positive or negative, leveraging both traditional and deep learning approaches.

## Dataset Summary
The IMDB dataset consists of:
- **50,000 movie reviews** labeled as either positive or negative.
- **Training set**: 25,000 reviews
- **Testing set**: 25,000 reviews
